# Implementation
Welcome to the final Implementation of our project— our e-commerce website that sells rocketships. This implementation would create users new users when they'd like to register, or allow current ones to log-in, browse the page of our rockets, add them to a shopping cart for purchase, and allow them to order the rockets— many if they'd like.

## Objectives

The project had many objectives, ranging from creating users to printing all orders into a table. Unfortunately, the implementation we were unable to complete, just not having enough knowledge or time to properly get certain aspects and objectives implemented into the working software. On the bright side, some of the more key aspects we completed, and are accessible and workable on the website when running.

### Completed Objectives
* Have a working, viewable page for all aspects of the website— log-in and registration, the shopping cart, the products, and a small page about our group
* Register new customers to the database
* Check and properly create unique IDs for each user, product, shipping type, and order
* Having all newly created users registered without admin privileges
* Prevent the creation of a user that already exists in the database
* Log the user in to the website
* Display the products along with their pertinent information, along with their availability status and working image
* Get a working, yet empty order page with all of its pertinent information— for the sales report

### Uncomplete Objectives
* Keep user logins persistent across the website
* Once the program shuts down, the database resets and the users have to reregister
* Complete orders and add products to the user's shopping cart— this prevents any checking of order data
* Create new admins at the disposal of the seed admins
* Print a sales report
