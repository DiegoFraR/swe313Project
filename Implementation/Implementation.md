# Implementation
Welcome to the final Implementation of our project— our e-commerce website that sells rocketships. This implementation would create users new users when they'd like to register, or allow current ones to log in, browse the page of our rockets, add them to a shopping cart for purchase, and allow them to order the rockets— many if they'd like.

Front-End Developers: David Lowe & Eunsu You
Back-End Developers: Matthew Elledge & Diego Frausto Ramirez

## Objectives

The project had many objectives, ranging from creating users to printing all orders into a table. Unfortunately, the implementation we were unable to complete the, just did not have enough knowledge or time to properly get certain aspects and objectives implemented into the working software. On the bright side, some of the more key aspects we completed, and are accessible and workable on the website when running.

### Completed Objectives
* Have a working, viewable page for all aspects of the website— log-in and registration, the shopping cart, the products, and a small page about our group
* Register new customers to the database
* Check and properly create unique IDs for each user, product, shipping type, and order
* Having all newly created users registered without admin privileges
* Prevent the creation of a user that already exists in the database
* Log the user into the website
* Display the products along with their pertinent information, along with their availability status and working image
* Get a working, yet empty order page with all of its pertinent information in the database— for the sales report

### Uncomplete Objectives
* Keep user logins persistent across the website
* Once the program shuts down, the database resets, and the manually created users have to reregister
* Complete orders and add products to the user's shopping cart— this prevents any checking of order data
* Create new admins at the disposal of the seed admins
* Print a sales report

## Challenges/Issues
This project was very difficult, in fact, one of the hardest, of which I'm sure all of us would agree. At the very least our two backend developers would agree. On the day of submission, we've likely put 35+ hours into this project, staying late on the optional days, working over break on the project to get a headstart, as well as on top of other course work, putting several hours in each day to ensure the project works smoothly.

For our backend, we had never worked with Spring before, and sparsely with SQL or JSON. This created some major challenges for us. We had to attempt to learn Spring in a very rapid timeframe to get the project working, and when we came in contact with issues— of which we had a ton— we had to dig deep and search through our code to hope we could find it. Not only this, but we also struggled at the beginning working with solely JSON for several days, before switching to SQL, which turned out to be a much better decision. Lesson learned there.

Lastly, we also tried a full fresh start on Wednesday morning, the day before submission was due, in JavaFX, of which both of us had a very poor understanding to begin with; yet thankfully kept our working, albeit unfinished Spring application. We had great strides there but struggled with connecting our views with our backend code, and ultimately just did not have enough time to remedy our problems. It is clear we were unfortunately unable to complete the project in its entirety, but one thing that can be said is that we worked our hardest, and put in the necessary effort to complete this project. However, we appreciate the complexity of working with a website and Spring and feel like we've learned a lot from this project, especially the amount of time and effort that goes into creating a working project in a real scenario.
