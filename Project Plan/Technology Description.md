## Language
### Java
We selected Java as our implementation Language. We selected Java because all the members of our team have worked in Java in the past.
Java provides us one less obstacle to learn as we will be learning how to use Grails and JSON (more on this later). 

## Framework
### Grails
We selected Grails as our framework because we are building a web-based java solution for our project. Grails provides a simple, consistent 
and encourages rapid development. Grails provides us a streamlined web development process which allows us to spend less time configuring 
and more time coding the application itself. Gralis also comes with Groovy, a programming language that has easy-to-learn syntax. The mixture 
of easy to learn syntax and a relatively flat learning curve compared to other frameworks is why we chose Grails.

## Storage Plan
### JSON
We Selected JSON as our storage option because, compared to SQL, it is more flexible and our professor (Jeff Adkinson) will be teching JSON 
outside of class. This way, all of our group members know how the storage option functions, as well as learn a new way to implement storage. 

## Operating Environment
### Windows, MacOS, Linux, Etc. 
Since we are developing a web-based solution, our application will work in any operating environment.
