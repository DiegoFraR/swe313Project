## Language
### Java
We selected Java as our implementation Language. We selected Java because all the members of our team have worked in Java in the past.
Java provides us one less obstacle to learn as we will be learning how to use Grails and JSON (more on this later). 

## Framework
### Spring (Grails Sucks)
We selected Spring as our framework because we are building a web-based java solution for our project. Spring provides a simple, consistent 
and encourages rapid development. Spring provides us a streamlined web development process which allows us to spend less time configuring 
and more time coding the application itself. Spring is also coded in Java, which means our team has to learn one less language. 


## Storage Plan
### JSON
We Selected JSON as our storage option because, compared to SQL, it is more flexible and our professor (Jeff Adkisson) will be teaching JSON 
outside of class. This way, all of our group members know how the storage option functions, as well as learn a new way to implement storage. 

## Operating Environment
### Windows, MacOS, Linux, Etc. 
Since we are developing a web-based solution, our application will work in any operating environment. 

## Other Software
### YouTrack
We will be using YouTrack to organize and plan our project out. This way, we know what needs to be worked on and how urgent aspects of our project are.

### Marvel
We will use Marvel to design the UI of our application. Marvel provides us with lots of flexibility, basic design, and has a quick learning curve for new users.
