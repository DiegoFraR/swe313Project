# Coding Style Guide

## Information about our style
* This is the guide we're going to follow while we create and write effective and optimized code in Java for this project.\
 -- [Java's Coding Style Guide](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/JavaStyle.html) --

 Our Additions to the Guide:
* On top of this guide, we have a few of our own individual parameters surrounding certain topics so that we ensure the project flows smoothly, such as :
   - Project Access and Management
  - Specific Commenting
  
### Project Access and Management
- For this, we're storing all of our project information in a Github Repository to ensure everything is accessible anywhere and in the same place.
- When posting large updates to the repository or writing overtop of old information, check with at least one other group member to have them read over your changes to prevent unnecessary mistakes.
- This allows great future access while still on the project: looking into this repository for artifacts and information to see how to best make changes or debug any part of the project with little to no issue.
  - Also storing this here is great for being past the project and the class itself because it is accessible and readable to any future employer, or anyone interested in scouting our skills.

 ### Commenting
 - Our commenting will be brief but informative to ensure the reader is able to follow along the programmer's thought process while it was being writtenâ€” what each line of code is doing.
 - The comments will also follow our naming scheme that is shown throughout our Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in order to reference pieces that connect to each other.
 - Our commenting style and names will allow us to easily show connections between our JSON database, Spring Framework for our website, as well as our backend code in Java.
