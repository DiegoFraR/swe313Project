## Information about Data Storage Plan
### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
* Language independent
* Lightweight data-interchange format
* We selected JSON as our storage plan for our e-commerce website.
* All the objects will be stored within a single JSON document. 
### Jackson
* We will be using the Jackson library to convert JSON strings and POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).
* Allows for future implementation for data formats such as CSV, YML, and XML.
* Requires the least overhead for Streaming API
